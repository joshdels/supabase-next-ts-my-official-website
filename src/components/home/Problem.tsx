// 🧩 2. Problem Storytelling – Why GIS Matters in Real Estate
// Goal:

// Show you understand real client pain, not just tools.

// Structure:

// Problem → Consequences → Your Solution

// Example:

// The Problem
// Real estate decisions are often made using spreadsheets and intuition—ignoring spatial patterns like accessibility, demand clustering, and land constraints.

// The Result
// Poor site selection, inefficient housing allocation, and missed investment opportunities.

// My Solution
// I use GIS and data visualization to reveal location-based insights—helping stakeholders see risks, opportunities, and patterns before they build or invest.

// This sets you up as a strategic thinker, not just technical.
